# Assignment 3 

This assignment does not have any base work, it was all from scratch !
The idea here was an endless game and to continue as much as possible the game.
The goal is to guess the director or actor of a movie and find a movie this person has played in and back to the guess of director or actor.

You can't say the name of a movie twice !

There is room for improvement for this game ! Like for example a counter that will give you a score.

Of course the base idea is the biggest score the best but you can also add minigame inside. Start from a big american film and you must end with Louis de Funès, with the smallest score as possible. (I tried with friends and it took us an 1hr and 112 guesses... (starting from Edge of Tomorrow))

## Features

The app will tell you the title in english but you can search movie title in french also !

## API Key disclaimer 🙇‍♂️

I know, I know, I should not have put my API Key in the browser side JavaScript... 😥

But this was my understanding of the assignment, because I had to deposit only static html and js files so no node back-end where to store the API Key and make the request...

(Don't do that in your project, I had to delete the previous repository because I commited the API Key...)
