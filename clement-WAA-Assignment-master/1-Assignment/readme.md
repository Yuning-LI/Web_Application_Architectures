# Assignment 1 💾

The idea here was simple, I had to start from the [whiteboard](https://github.com/Tnemlec/Whiteboard) app and add a button in the controlbar that will open your drawing in a new window that you can: right click 👉 Save image as.

## What changed 😮🤔 ?

Not much code has changed between the original app and those static files.
To save you some time here is what have changed:
 - In the HTML 👓 :
   - Line 77 ▶ 80 👉 Add the button
 - In the JavaScript 👨‍💻 :
   - Line 207 ▶ 209 👉 Function that will open the new window

Of course this open in all browsers 😎
