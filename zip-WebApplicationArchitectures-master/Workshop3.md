## WS 3.1 Simple HTML / CSS Exercise


**Must read:**  https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/css-box-model/ in case you did not.  
**Must read:**  https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp

you must understand difference between BLOCK and INLINE Html elements 


don't put BLOCK elements inside INLINE elements !
`<P></P>` blocks only allows inline elements. If  you put block elements inside `<P></P>` browsers will treat them as if they were outside `<P></P>`.

**Must read:** https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp

you must understand how fonts are displayed in a browser. Sometimes, a font you choosed will not be available on a visitor's computer. His browser will then have to pick another font. Visually speaking, the results could break all your design work !


### then
